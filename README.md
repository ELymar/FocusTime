Distractions are annoying. Let's try to stay focused and kill distractions!

Kill the distracting apps by shooting at them. Press the home button to shoot. Try to kill as many as you can before you run out of battery. As you shoot, keep an eye on your service bars, when you have no service, you can't shoot! See how high you can score.
